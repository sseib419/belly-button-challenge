# belly-button-challenge

In order to create the dashboard exploring belly button data, first the wesite with the sample data was read using D3. A drop down was created to select the specific sample ID to view. Then a panel showing the demographic info of the sample was created, pulling metadata like the ID, ethnicity, and gender of the sample. A bar chart showing the number of bacteria for the top 10 cultures found within that sample was created as well, and when hovering over each bar you can see the sample label. Lastly a bubble chart showing all of the different cultures found in the sample was created, with the size of the bubble depending on the sample value amount, and the X axis being the IDs for the bacteria. When hovering over the bubble, the label of the bacteria is displayed. 

This dashboard can be seen by viewing the index.html file, where a webpage will open and a test subject to be viewed can be selected.
